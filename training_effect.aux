\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces There was a training effect from training with the filter-based feedback compared to training with no feedback. The RMS error, balance time, and time to success of the training group in the final set was significantly better than that of the control group. It is also worth noting that as expected, pairwise comparisons of the two groups in set 1 show that there was not a significant difference in their baseline performance measurements. Moreover, set was consistently the most significant factor in performance improvements from set 1 to set 3, showing that both groups (training and control) improved significantly over time. Finally note that error bars indicate standard error and significance is indicated by $^*p<0.05$, $^{**}p<0.01$, $^{***}p<0.001$.\relax }}{4}}
