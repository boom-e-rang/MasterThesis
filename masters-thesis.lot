\contentsline {table}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces Correlation results between initial skill level and controller engagement. Pearson's correlation tests were performed by applying a linear model to the participant skill level, as estimated from performance measures in the last 10 trials of set 1, and the frequency of controller intervention in the training set---the PRA in set 2. The expected sign of the correlation coefficient ($r$) for a shared control scheme that is sensitive to the performance of the user is indicated in the column on the left. There was a weak but significant correlation between the current performance of the user and PRA for success rate, balance time, and time to success. For RMS error, results were statistically insignificant ($p=0.86$). \relax }}{45}{table.caption.20}
